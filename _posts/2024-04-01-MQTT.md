# MQTT

MQTT is the most commonly used messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT)\
The protocol is event driven and connects devices using the publish /subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern.\
The sender (Publisher) and the receiver (Subscriber) communicate via Topics.\
The Publisher and Subscriber are decoupled from each other.\
The connection between them is handled by the MQTT broker.\

install 
`pip install paho-mqtt`

client api
<https://eclipse.dev/paho/files/paho.mqtt.python/html/client.html>

is `$SYS` same as `/mqtt` ? in <https://mqtt.eclipseprojects.io/>

No, just string `$SYS`

## conclusion

One client is Subscriber, first connect to borker, then sub a topic, and loop waiting message.\
The other client is publisher, but I can use publish only, no need for a client. And publish single message is enough.

## next JSON format msg
The message format should be in a JSON format.
