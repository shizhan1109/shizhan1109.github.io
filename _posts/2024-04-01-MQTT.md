MQTT is the most commonly used messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT)
The protocol is event driven and connects devices using the publish /subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern.
The sender (Publisher) and the receiver (Subscriber) communicate via Topics.
The Publisher and Subscriber are decoupled from each other.
The connection between them is handled by the MQTT broker.
